# DIR
Project on deformable image registration for DSP course at UCT

## Baseline 
The baseline model comes from the open source [SimpleElastix Medical Image Registration Library](https://simpleelastix.github.io) and does not leverage deep learning in its approach to solving the image registration task.

## Learning Approach
The learning approach uses a convolutional architecture as outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08608).
